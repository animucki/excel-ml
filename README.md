Can we use MS Excel for machine learning?

## Data:

Heart disease classification dataset from Kaggle: [link](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)

## Method

Logistic regression

## Result:

Using pure Excel: not feasible.
Using the Solver add-in: doable!

## Conclusion:
Took 4 hours to code. While it's cool that you can do matrix operations and optimization in Excel, it is very error-prone and just janky. I didn't bother to do any validation, but it would be easy to add. Do not do this.
